            <h1>TENOR/BASS CHOIR</h1>
            <p>Tenor/Bass choir is Thunder Ridge High School’s beginning Men’s choir and does not require an audition to join. It is recommended for all incoming freshmen and anyone else who is giving choir a try for the first time. Here, you will learn how to read music; how to sing and count. You will discover what voice part you sing, and what your range is. The best part about the Tenor/Bass choir is the friends that you will make there, and the opportunity it will bring you and them to move forward and join the auditioned mixed choirs and excel as a choral musician throughout the rest of your high school years! Tenor/Bass choir is held during 5th period-1st and 2nd trimester. Then the tenor/bass choir and the soprano/alto choir combine for the 3rd trimester and form the Una Voce mixed choir held during 1st period.</p>
