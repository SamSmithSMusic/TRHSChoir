            <h1>CHAMBER CHOIR</h1>
            <p>Chamber Choir is Thunder Ridge High Schoolâ€™s top select mixed choir. This is an audition-only choir and has specific performance attire requirements. These are the choir students who are committed to choir and want to go the extra mile. Not only do these students learn the most advanced music in the choir program, but they also participate in two additional college choral invitationals requiring them to learn several additional college level pieces of music. The students are expected to dive deep into their assigned music and work together to make something extra special. This choir also participates in Festival with Vivace Mixed Choir and goes on tour in the spring. This choir meets Tuesday - Friday during zero hour at 7:30 am.</p>
