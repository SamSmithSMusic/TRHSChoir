            <h1>VIVACE MIXED CHOIR</h1>
            <p>Vivace is Thunder Ridge High Schoolâ€™s advanced mixed choir. It is an audition-only group and is reserved for those students who are prepared to use more advanced music skills to deliver a higher level performance. It is an honor to be in this class, and it is a year long commitment. You will be expected to purchase the correct performance attire and make sure you will be able to commit to all the performance times included in your syllabus at the beginning of each trimester Auditions for this choir are usually held in April the year before, but if you are a new student and have already participated in choir for a year or two, you may audition at the beginning of the school year. Becoming a member of Vivace Choir means you will have amazing opportunities such as performing in school and community events and festivals as well as going on tour in the spring. This choir meets in 3rd period every day all year.</p>
